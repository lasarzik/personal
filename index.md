# Robert Lasarzik
## Welcome
Welcome to my webpage. I am a PostDoc at the WIAS Berlin. 

My research mainly focuses on the theory of generalized solutions to the Ericksen--Leslie model describing the flow of liquid crystals. 

# Research 
- Generalized solutions to the Ericksen--Leslie model

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/lasarzik/personal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
